Thank you for your interest in contributing to ValuableEnums!

## Initial Setup

1. Download and install the .NET 9 SDK:
  - Instructions can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/).
2. If you don't have contributor access to this repository:
  - Fork the repository on GitHub
  - Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repo-name}.git`
3. If you have contributor access:
  - Clone directly: `git clone https://github.com/NocturnalGroup/valuable-enums.git`
4. From the repository root, restore the required .NET tools:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```

## Code Style

We maintain a consistent code style across the project using several tools:

### EditorConfig

At the root of the project there is an `.editorconfig` file that helps ensure consistent:

- Indentation
- Line endings
- Character encoding

Please make sure you have the EditorConfig plugin installed in your editor:

- [Rider (Included)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig/)
- [Visual Studio (Included)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes-v15.0#coding-convention-support-through-editorconfig)
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [Other Editors](https://editorconfig.org/#download)

### CSharpier

We use CSharpier to ensure consistent C# code formatting.
You can format the entire project by running:

```bash
dotnet csharpier .
```

Or format a specific file:

```bash
dotnet csharpier YourFile.cs
```

For the best development experience, we recommend installing the CSharpier plugin for your editor:

- [Rider](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18243-csharpier)
- [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csharpier.CSharpier)
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csharpier.csharpier-vscode)
- [Other Editors](https://csharpier.com/docs/Editors)

## General Workflow

1. Create a branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes.
3. Validate your changes:

```bash
dotnet test
dotnet csharpier .
```

4. Commit your changes (see Commit Guidelines below).
5. Push your changes.
6. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch.

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for our commit messages.
Each commit message should match the following format:

```
{type}({scope}): {description}
```

#### Types

We use a simplified set of commit types.
The available types are:

| Type     | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| build    | All build system changes.            |
| feat     | Code changes that add a new feature. |
| fix      | Code changes that fix a bug.         |
| refactor | All other code changes.              |
| docs     | All documentation changes.           |
| repo     | All other changes.                   |
| revert   | Reverting a previous commit.         |

#### Scope (Optional)

In most cases, it's a good idea to provide a scope.
A scope helps people to identify which section of the codebase your commit makes changes to.

```
# Without scope
feat: add endpoint for user preferences

# With Scope
feat(api): add an endpoint for user preferences
```

#### Breaking Changes

If your commit includes a breaking change, you should signify this by adding a `!` after the scope.

```
{type}({scope})!: {description}
```

#### Description

The description of your commit should be written in the imperative mood.
An easy way to achieve this is to complete the following sentence:

```
If applied, this commit will {description}
```

#### Examples

```
feat(api): add an endpoint for user preferences
fix(auth): resolve token validation issue
docs: update installation instructions
```

### Focused Commits

Commits should be focused and address a single logical change.
Multipurpose commits can be harder to understand and revert.
Please keep commits reasonably sized and focused on one subject.

For example, instead of combining multiple changes into a single commit like this:

```
fix(users): add last name field to search endpoint and changed its ratelimit
```

It's better to break them down into separate, focused commits:

```
feat(users): add support for querying by last name
fix(users): increase the query endpoint rate limit allowance
```
